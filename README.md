## Features

- Atomic design
- Accessible
- Platform-agnostic
- Integrated with Drupal: https://www.drupal.org/project/civictheme

## Installing

```bash
npm install @civictheme/uikit
```

or download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/civictheme/uikit/releases).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

If a specific change is being proposed (either a new feature or a bug fix), you 
can [create an issue](https://github.com/civictheme/uikit/issues/new) documenting the proposed 
change.

## Maintenance

### Updating minor dependencies

```bash
npm install -g npm-check-updates
npx npm-check-updates -u --target minor
```

### Pre-release build

All commits to `main` branch are built as a Storybook and automatically deployed to https://civictheme-uikit.netlify.app/

### Build assets

    npm run build

This will build:

- CSS and JS assets in the `dist` directory. These files can be included
  directly into your HTML page, provided that it has components implemented with
  the same markup as components in the `componets` directory.
- Storybook assets as compiled HTML page in the `storybook-static` directory.
  These files can be served publically to show all components available in the
  library.

### Check and fix code style

    npm run lint

    npm run lint-fix

### Run Storybook

    npm run storybook

## Releasing

Releases to GitHub and NPM are automated via GitHub Actions, but initiated
manually.

the [Release package](https://github.com/civictheme/uikit/actions/workflows/release-manual.yml)
GitHub Action, click on the `Run workflow` button, and enter the release
level: `patch` or `minor`.

After the release is complete, the new version will be available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/civictheme/uikit/releases)
