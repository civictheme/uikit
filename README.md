### Build assets

This will build:

- CSS and JS assets in the `dist` directory. These files can be included
  directly into your HTML page, provided that it has components implemented with
  the same markup as components in the `componets` directory.
- Storybook assets as compiled HTML page in the `storybook-static` directory.
  These files can be served publically to show all components available in the
  library.
